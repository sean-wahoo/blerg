### well would you look at that i finally "finished" the bl[o|er]g

**obviously** it'll be constantly evolving and changing but whatever. right now i think i need to make and learn as much as i can and try to keep my head above water.

maybe next i'll make a thing to track or enforce consistently coding or writing here or something. it gets pretty difficult for me to come up with ideas and stick with them to the end. i get caught up in "but what if it already exists that's not very innovative developer of you". i probably need to stop worrying about things that already exist and just create what i want to.


there's lots of things i'd like to try and learn, but not everything really needs to be a website. at least whatever random shit i churn out isn't made by some fucking clanker. i've played enough cyberpunk to see where the world is headed and it's got me all >:(

_my reaction to the state of it all_
</div>

as comforting as it would be, being made of glorious flesh with a real soul and the divine blessing of the programmer does not income make. to be fair, neither will yapping here, but this is CODE i'm CODING. i'm gonna head out and finish this shit. maybe i'll add a nice little background at some point. if i'm inconsistent to any degree, please come to my house and beat the shit out of me.


bye bye love you
